## **Visualizing Hypothesis Tests in Multivariate Linear Models**

Version 1.4-0

## Description

The `heplots` package provides functions for visualizing hypothesis tests in
multivariate linear models (MANOVA, multivariate multiple regression, MANCOVA,
and repeated measures designs).

HE plots represent sums-of-squares-and-products matrices for linear hypotheses (**H**) and for 
error (**E**) using ellipses (in two dimensions), ellipsoids (in three dimensions),
or by line segments in one dimension.
For the theory and applications, see: 

* Fox, Friendly and Monette (2009) for a brief introduction,
* Friendly (2010) for the application of these ideas to repeated measure designs,
* Friendly, Monette and Fox (2013) for a general discussion of the role of elliptical geometry in statistical understanding, and
* Friendly & Sigal (2017) for an applied R tutorial.

Other topics now addressed here include:

* robust MLMs, using iteratively re-weighted least squared to down-weight observations with large multivariate residuals, `robmlm()`. 
* `Mahalanobis()` calculates classical and robust Mahalanobis squared distances using MCD and MVE estimators of center and covariance.
* visualizing tests for equality of covariance matrices in MLMs (Box's M test), `boxM()` and `plot.boxM()`. 
* $\chi^2$ Q-Q plots for MLMs (`cqplot()`) to detect outliers and assess multivariate normality of residuals.
* bivariate coefficient plots showing elliptical confidence regions (`coefplot()`).

In this respect, the `heplots` package now aims to provide a wide range of tools for analyzing and visualizing
multivariate response linear models.

* The related [`candisc`](http://github.com/friendly/candisc) package provides HE plots in **canonical discriminant** space, the space of linear combinations of the responses that show the maximum possible effects
and for canonical correlation in multivariate regression designs.

* Another package, [`mvinfluence`](https://friendly.github.io/mvinfluence/), provides diagnostic measures and
plots for influential observations in MLM designs.


Several tutorial vignettes are also included.  See `vignette(package="heplots")`.

## HE plot functions

The graphical functions contained here all display multivariate model
effects in variable (**data**) space, for one or more response variables
(or contrasts among response variables in repeated measures designs).

* `heplot()` constructs two-dimensional HE plots for model terms and 
linear hypotheses for pairs of response variables in multivariate linear models.

* `heplot3d()` constructs analogous 3D plots for triples of response
variables.
 
* The `pairs` method, `pairs.mlm()` constructs a scatterplot matrix of pairwise HE plots.

* `heplot1d()` constructs 1-dimensional analogs of HE plots for model terms and 
linear hypotheses for single response variables.


## Other functions

* `glance.mlm()` extends `broom::glance.lm()` to multivariate response models, giving a one-line statistical summary for each response variable.

* `boxM()` Calculates Box's _M_ test for homogeneity of covariance matrices in a MANOVA design. A `plot` method displays a visual representation of the components of the test. Associated with this, `bartletTests()` and
`levineTests()` give the univariate tests of homogeneity of variance for each response measure in a MLM.

* `covEllipses()` draw covariance (data) ellipses for one or more group, optionally including the ellipse for the pooled within-group covariance.

### Repeated measure designs

For repeated measure designs, between-subject effects and within-subject
effects must be plotted separately, because the error terms (**E** matrices)
differ.  For terms involving within-subject effects,
these functions carry out a linear
transformation of the matrix **Y** of responses to a matrix **Y M**, where
**M** is the model matrix for a term in
the intra-subject design and produce plots of
the H and E matrices in this transformed space. The vignette `"repeated"` describes
these graphical methods for repeated measures designs. 
(At present, this vignette is only available at [HE plots for repeated measures designs](http://www.jstatsoft.org/v37/i04/paper).)

## Datasets

The package also provides a large collection of  data sets illustrating
a variety of multivariate linear models of the types listed above,
together with graphical displays. The table below classifies these with
method tags. Their names are linked to the documentation on the
`pkgdown` website, [http://friendly.github.io/heplots].

<!--
dsets <- vcdExtra::datasets("heplots")[, c("Item", "dim", "Title")]
rowcols <- as.data.frame(stringr::str_split_fixed(dsets$dim,"x", 2))
colnames(rowcols) <- c("rows", "cols")

dsets.table <- cbind("dataset" = dsets$Item, rowcols, "title" =dsets$Title)
knitr::kable(dsets.table)
-->


```{r datasets, echo=FALSE}
library(here)
library(DT)
library(dplyr)
dsets <- read.csv(here::here("extra", "datasets.csv"))
dsets <- dsets[,-1]  # remove row number

# link dataset to pkgdown doc
refurl <- "http://friendly.github.io/heplots/reference/"

dsets <- dsets |>
  mutate(dataset = glue::glue("[{dataset}]({refurl}{dataset}.html)")) 

knitr::kable(dsets)

# doesn't work -- can't find phantomJS
#DT::datatable(dsets, 
#              options = list(pageLength = 15),
#              rownames = FALSE,
#              filter = "none")
```


## Examples

This example illustrates HE plots using the classic `iris` data set. How do the means
of the flower variables differ by `Species`? This dataset was the imputus for
R. A. Fisher (1936) to propose a method of discriminant analysis using data collected
by Edgar Anderson (1928). Though some may rightly deprecate Fisher for being a
supporter of eugenics, Anderson's `iris` dataset should not be blamed.

A basic HE plot shows the **H** and **E**
ellipses for the first two response variables (here: `Sepal.Length` and `Sepal.Width`).
The multivariate test is significant
(by Roy's test) *iff* the **H** ellipse projects *anywhere* outside the **E** ellipse.

The positions of the group means show how they differ on the two response variables shown,
and provide an interpretation of the orientation of the **H** ellipse: it is long in the
directions of differences among the means.

```{r iris1, out.width="70%"}
#| echo=-1
par(mar=c(4,4,1,1)+.1)
iris.mod <- lm(cbind(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, Petal.Length, Petal.Width) ~ 
                 Species, data=iris)
heplot(iris.mod)
```

Contrasts or other linear hypotheses can be shown as well, and the ellipses look better
if they are filled. We create contrasts to test the differences between `versacolor` and
`virginca` and also between `setosa` and the average of the other two. Each 1 df contrast plots
as degenerate 1D ellipse-- a line. 

Because these contrasts are orthogonal, they add to the total 2 df effect
of `Species`. Note how the first contrast, labeled `V:V`, distinguishes the means of
*versicolor* from *virginica*;
the second contrast, `S:VV` distinguishes `setosa` from the other two.


```{r iris2, out.width="70%"}
par(mar=c(4,4,1,1)+.1)
contrasts(iris$Species)<-matrix(c(0, -1, 1, 
                                  2, -1, -1), nrow=3, ncol=2)
contrasts(iris$Species)
iris.mod <- lm(cbind(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, Petal.Length, Petal.Width) ~ 
                 Species, data=iris)

hyp <- list("V:V"="Species1","S:VV"="Species2")
heplot(iris.mod, hypotheses=hyp, 
       fill=TRUE, fill.alpha=0.1)
```

All pairwise HE plots are produced using the `pairs` method for MLM objects.

```{r, iris3, out.width="100%"}
pairs(iris.mod, hypotheses=hyp, hyp.labels=FALSE,
      fill=TRUE, fill.alpha=0.1)
```
