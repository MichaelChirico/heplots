How to have `pkgdown` use figure numbers and cross-references in vignettes?

I've created several vignettes for a package, with figures I want to reference in the text.
Using the template for a `.Rmd` vignette, I can do this by using `bookdown::html_document2` as follows in my yaml header:

    output: 
      bookdown::html_document2:
        base_format: rmarkdown::html_vignette
        fig_caption: yes
        toc: true

Yet, when I build the associated `pkgdown` site, I don't get figure numbers or cross-references,
done with `\@ref(fig:chunk_name)`.

Is there some magic I can add to my `_pkgdown.yml` file to have it use the bookdown output format?
